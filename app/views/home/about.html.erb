<h1>Time Bottler</h1>
<p class='highlight'>Time bottler is a client, project and time management tool.  This Ruby on Rails web application allows users to keep track of client and project information, to time billable tasks and to generate reports.</p>
<p class='highlight'>This app was developed by <a href='http://www.it-kutch.com' target='_blank'>Aaron Washburn</a> as part of <a href='http://www.thefirehoseproject.com' target='_blank'>the Firehose Project</a> Ruby on Rails coding bootcamp.</p>
<h2>Users</h2>
<p class='highlight'>Each user must sign_in to access the application. If you're browsing you are welcome to sign in as <span style='font-weight: bold;'>cbabbage@example.com</span> with password of <span style='font-weight: bold;'>cbabbage</span>.</p>
<h2>Dashboard</h2>
<p class='highlight'>Click on the Time Bottler logo at any time to see the dashboard. The dashbord shows you recent Clients, Projects, Tasks and Reports. Click on any of these headings for a complete listing.  Click on any individual item to view details.</p>
<h2>Clients</h2>
<p class='highlight'>Clicking Clients from the dashboard takes you to a listing of existing clients with the option below to add a new client. Client information includes client contact information, default billable rate for all client projects as well as a one of eight icons and a full color palette to identify all events associated with this client.</p>
<h2>Collaborations</h2>
<p class='highlight'>While each client has just one User as owner, that User can add Collaborators by Collaborator ID or by email address. Collaborators have all priveleges of an owner.</p>
<p class='highlight'></p>
<h2>Projects & Tasks</h2>
<p class='highlight'>Projects represent broad categories within a client - for instance 'Develop Website' or 'Rebranding'.  Tasks are subcategories within a Project - 'Gather customer marketing feedback' and 'Brainstorm color theme', allowing fine control of time tracking and report generation.</p>
<p class='highlight'>Projects and tasks inherit billable rate as well as icon and color identification from the parent client.</p>
<h2>Events</h2>
<p class='highlight'>Events represent timed, billable events.  The event name will be autogenerated with a current time stamp, but can be changed anytime during the timing event. Note that the timer will glow red (stopped), yellow (paused) or green(running) to give a visual clue to the current state.</p>
